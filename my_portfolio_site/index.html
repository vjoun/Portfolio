					<p>â€œA strong and effective front-end developer shows a determined focus and obsession on what users and customers need and want.

						They start with the use-case of the customer and works backwards, working tirelessly to earn and maintain customer
						trust by building the front-end of products.<br><br>

						Strong front-end developers own their products and own solutions. They need to think medium to long term while delivering immediate product results.

						A good front-end developer uses project tracking tools to track changes, demonstrate progress, and most importantly let their peers know why changes
						are being made and when.
